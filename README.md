# Lazy-Cpp
A simple wrapper class over [std::optional](https://www.bfilipek.com/2018/05/using-optional.html) for Lazy Loading of Resources.

For more information about *Lazy Loading Pattern* please refer to the article [Lazy Loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading) from wikipedia.org

Simply speaking, Lazy Loading initializes a resource only when you need it i.e it follows the philosophy *"use it when you need it"*. 

C++ natively does not support Lazy pattern . Hence i wrote a simple wrapper over it.
